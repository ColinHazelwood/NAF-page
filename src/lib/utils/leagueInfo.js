  <p>The League... Everyone wants to be a winner, but only a few have what it takes. As we all sadly work our 9-5s, we all look forward to one thing... Sundays.</p> 
  <p>Our glorious host, Scott Hanson, gets us on edge all week to see the octobox live on TV.</p> 
  <p>Sunday is the day when the boys can get together, laugh, drink, talk shit, but most importantly, slam nasty parlays and watch our fantasy teams kick ass (unless you're Specker).</p> 
  <p>In this league, we have three types of people... The people who have no idea what they're doing (Keon Coleman at 4), the people who claim to be good (I hAvE tHe MoSt PoInTs ScOrEd AlL tImE), and the degenerates (Cam Akers and Devin Singlscary).</p> <p>At the end of the day, everyone wants to know...
